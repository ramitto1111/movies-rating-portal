## Movies & TV Shows Rating System
<p>
used the laravel voyager admin panel as I used to use it in order to make it easier for adding movies and TV shows.<br />
The link will be like:http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
Email: admin@admin.com<br />
Password: password<br />
I added the movies and TV shows under section "items" <br />
    <br />
But first you have to clone the repository and create "movie_rating" Database using phpmyadmin, and import the file movie_rating.sql (you will find it on the root)<br />
    After that you can #run php artisan serve# on your command line<br />
    and you will get the link like: http://127.0.0.1:8000
    <br />
    Put in your browser and you will see the result.
